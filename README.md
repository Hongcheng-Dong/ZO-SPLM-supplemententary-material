### Key Theoretical Contributions

1. **Convergence Guarantee**: Proved convergence to stationary points under standard smoothness assumptions
2. **Sample Complexity**: Established O(d/Œµ¬≤) sample complexity bound for Œµ-stationary points
3. **High Probability Results**: Derived concentration inequalities for finite-sample guarantees
4. **Structural Properties**: Showed preservation of optimization landscape structure

### Mathematical Framework

The ZO-SPLM algorithm uses coordinate-wise finite differences for gradient estimation:

```
ƒù·µ¢(x) = [f(x + Œºe·µ¢) - f(x - Œºe·µ¢)]/(2Œº)
```

With update rule:
```
x_{t+1} = x_t - Œ±_t ƒù_t
```

### Key Results

- **Convergence Rate**: O(log T / T) for smooth convex functions
- **Function Evaluations**: 2d per iteration (optimal for coordinate methods)
- **Noise Robustness**: Handles observation noise with œÉ¬≤ variance
- **Dimension Dependence**: Scales as O(d) rather than O(d¬≤) of sphere methods

### Usage

```python
from zo_splm_implementation import ZOSPLMOptimizer, ZOSPLMConfig

# Configure optimizer
config = ZOSPLMConfig(mu=1e-2, alpha_init=1e-1, max_iterations=1000)
optimizer = ZOSPLMOptimizer(config)

# Optimize function
x_final, info = optimizer.optimize(objective_function, initial_point)
```

### Experimental Validation

Run the implementation to reproduce theoretical results:

```bash
python zo_splm_implementation.py
```

This generates convergence plots and complexity analysis confirming the theoretical predictions.
